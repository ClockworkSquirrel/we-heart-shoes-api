  Controller for interfacing with the Shoe Zone website and APIs.
  
  Available methods:
  - locateStore({ lat?: number = 0, lon?: number = 0, postcode?: string = "", city?: string = "" }): Promise<Object>
  - checkStoreStock({ styleCode: number, size: string, storeId: number, quantity?: number = 1 }): Promise<Object>
  - getProductInfo({ styleCode: number }): Promise<Object>
  
  All methods take their parameters as Objects with the keys described above, including methods which
  only take a single argument. This is for consistency across the controller's API.

  of a single style at a time. There is no way to determine quantities of stock, due to the API
  only returning a boolean value -- the only workaround would be incrementally checking quantities
  until the API returns false; however, this would most definitely spam the Shoe Zone servers (especially
  if a store has 500+ pairs in stock), and may even cause a DOS attack. This method will be revisited
  if Shoe Zone decided to provide an API which is capable of returning stock levels per store.
